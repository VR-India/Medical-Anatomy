  - objectName: LARYNX
    objectDescription: The larynx is a small structure of cartilage that connects
      the throat to the windpipe. It consists of nine cartilage structures, thyroid
      cartilage, epiglottis, cricoid cartilage, arytenoid cartilages, corniculate
      cartilages and cuneiform cartilages. It is found in the front of the neck and
      houses the vocal cords, producing speech sounds and contributing to respiration
  - objectName: TRACHEA
    objectDescription: The trachea is a tube-like structure in the neck and upper
      chest. The average length of the trachea is about 11.8cm. It stretches from
      the larynx, or voice box, to the bronchi and transports air to and from the
      lungs when a person breathes
  - objectName: BRONCHI
    objectDescription: The bronchi are the two large tubes that carry air from your
      windpipe to your lungs. You have a left and right main bronchus in each lung.
      After the main bronchi, these tubes branch out into segments that look like
      tree branches. As you breathe and your lungs expand, your bronchi distribute
      the air within your lung. The bronchi also help moisturize the air you breathe
      and screen out foreign particles
  - objectName: BRONCHIOLES
    objectDescription: The bronchioles are tubes in the lungs which branch off from
      the larger bronchi that enter each lung, from the large and singular trachea
      which connects to the mouth. As such, bronchioles are one of the smallest airways
      in the respiratory tract and lead directly to the alveolar ducts for exchanging
      gases in the blood
  - objectName: ALVEOLI
    objectDescription: These are tiny air sacs that function as basic respiratory
      units. It is a hollow cup-shaped cavity in the lung parenchyma, where gas exchange
      takes place. Lung alveoli are found in the acini at the beginning of the respiratory
      zone
  - objectName: LUNGS
    objectDescription: 'The lungs are pyramid shaped, paired organs that are connected
      to the trachea by the right and left bronchi, on the inferior surface the lungs
      are bordered by the diaphragm. The lungs are enclosed by the pleurae, that
      consists of two continuous membranes which are attached to the mediastinum.
      Each lung is composed of lobes, fissures separate these lobes form each other.
      The right lung has three lobes: the superior, middle and inferior lobes. The
      left lung consists of two lobes: the superior and inferior lobes. The major
      function of the lung is to perform gas exchange'
